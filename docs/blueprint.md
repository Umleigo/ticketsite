- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, ensuring readability and focus on content, matching a light color scheme.
- Accent color: A warm lavender (#B39DDB) is used for interactive elements such as buttons and links, complementing the primary color without overpowering the user interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, a modern, neutral look for clear readability in both headlines and body text.
